## Additional notes on mentor engagement
September 18th 2019
I used the Student hub function within Udacity website to interact with my mentor to get answers for my questions on the Bikeshare project. having a realtime mentor who can not only answer your question but also suggest you different ways to solve a problem was a huge confident booster for my project.
